Docker container that executes winbox (Mikrotik RouterOS configurator)
on Wine inside Debian Wheezy.

Image installation
------------------

$ docker build -t zanardo/winbox github.com/zanardo/docker-winbox


Host dependencies
-----------------

# aptitude install sshpass openssh-client
# wget -O /usr/local/bin/winbox.sh \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zanardo/docker-winbox/master/winbox.sh
# chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/winbox.sh

The X11 server on host must listen on TCP, for SSH X11 forwarding to work.


Running the container
---------------------

$ winbox.sh

A container named `winbox' will be created, showing winbox GUI on the host
machine. After winbox is closed, the container will be stopped instead of
destroyed so Wine configuration (and winbox downloaded DLLs) can persist.
