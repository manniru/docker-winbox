Docker container that executes winbox (Mikrotik RouterOS configurator)
on Wine inside Debian Wheezy.

Image installation
------------------

$ docker build -t zanardo/winbox github.com/zanardo/docker-winbox


Host dependencies
-----------------

# aptitude install sshpass openssh-client
# wget -O /usr/local/bin/winbox.sh \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zanardo/docker-winbox/master/winbox.sh
# chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/winbox.sh

The X11 server on host must listen on TCP, for SSH X11 forwarding to work.


Running the container
---------------------

$ winbox.sh

A container will be created, showing winbox GUI on the host machine. After
winbox is closed, the container will be destroyed, but Wine configurations and
winbox downloaded DLLs will persist on host $HOME/.docker-winbox.
